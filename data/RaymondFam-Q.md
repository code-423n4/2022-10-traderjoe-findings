## `constant` Variables Should be Capitalized
Constants should be named with all capital letters with underscores separating words if need be. Here are some of the instances entailed:

## Inadequately Commented Assembly Block
Assembly block is used in numerous contracts of Trader Joe. While this does not pose a security risk per se, it is at the same time a complicated and critical part of the system. Moreover, as this is a low-level language that is harder to parse by readers, consider including extensive documentation regarding the rationale behind its use, clearly explaining what every single assembly instruction does. This will make it easier for users to trust the code, for reviewers to verify it, and for developers to build on top of it or update it. Note that the use of assembly discards several important safety features of Solidity, which may render the code less safe and more error-prone.

Here are some of the instances entailed:

## External Call in Loop Could Lead to Denial of Service
Function calls made in unbounded loop are error-prone with potential resource exhaustion as it can trap the contract due to the gas limitations or failed transactions. Here are some of the instances entailed:

https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-traderjoe/blob/main/src/LBPair.sol#L496
https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-traderjoe/blob/main/src/LBPair.sol#L623

Consider bounding the loop where possible to avoid unnecessary gas wastage and denial of service.

## Failed Transfer Could Occur Without Contract Existence Check
Performing transfers with a low-level call without confirming contractâ€™s existence (not yet deployed or have been destructed) could return success even though no transfer was executed. Here is one of the instances entailed:

## `block.timestamp` Unreliable
The use of `block.timestamp` as part of the time checks can be slightly altered by miners/validators to favor them in contracts that have logic strongly dependent on them.

Consider taking into account this issue and warning the users that such a scenario could happen. If the alteration of timestamps cannot affect the protocol in any way, consider documenting the reasoning and writing tests enforcing that these guarantees will be preserved even if the code changes in the future.
