## Unspecific Compiler Version Pragma
For most source-units the compiler version pragma is very unspecific ^0.8.0. While this often makes sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of an application, it may be a security risk for the actual application implementation itself. A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up actually checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

Avoid floating pragmas where possible. It is highly recommend pinning a concrete compiler version (latest without security issues) in at least the top-level “deployed” contracts to make it unambiguous which compiler version is being used. Rule of thumb: a flattened source-unit should have at least one non-floating concrete solidity compiler version pragma.

## `constant` Variables Should be Capitalized
Constants should be named with all capital letters with underscores separating words if need be. Here are some of the instances entailed:
