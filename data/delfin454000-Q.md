### Long single line comments 
In theory, comments over 80 characters should wrap using multi-line comment syntax. Even if longer comments are acceptable and a scroll bar is provided, very long comments can interfere with readability. Below are five examples of lines or set of lines over 120 characters long that could be improved by wrapping, as shown:

                //    during the L568 and L569 if amounts were greater than uint112.

### Update sensitive terms in both comments and code
Terms incorporating "black," "white," "slave" or "master" are potentially problematic. Substituting more neutral terminology is becoming [common practice](https://www.zdnet.com/article/mysql-drops-master-slave-and-blacklist-whitelist-terminology/). `Trader Joe v2` currently incorporates `whitelist` and related terms, as the example below shows:
___
[LBFactory.sol: L76-80](https://github.com/code-423n4/2022-10-traderjoe/blob/79f25d48b907f9d0379dd803fc2abc9c5f57db93/src/LBFactory.sol#L76-L80)
```solidity
    /// @notice View function to return the number of quote assets whitelisted
    /// @return The number of quote assets
    function getNumberOfQuoteAssets() external view override returns (uint256) {
        return _quoteAssetWhitelist.length();
    }
```
Suggestion: Change `whitelisted` to `allowlisted` throughout. Similarly for other variants of `whitelist`.
