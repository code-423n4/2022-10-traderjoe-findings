## L003 - Unspecific Compiler Version Pragma
Avoid floating pragmas for non-library contracts.

While floating pragmas make sense for libraries to allow them to be included with multiple different versions of applications, it may be a security risk for application implementations.

A known vulnerable compiler version may accidentally be selected or security tools might fall-back to an older compiler version ending up checking a different EVM compilation that is ultimately deployed on the blockchain.

It is recommended to pin to a concrete compiler version.

For example:
🤦 Bad:
```
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;
```
🚀 Good:
```
pragma solidity 0.8.4;
```
